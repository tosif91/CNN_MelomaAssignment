# CNN_MelomaAssignment

### Problem statement:
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### There are 9 types of cancer disease

* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion

### Technologies Used
* python - version 3.8
* tensorflow - version 2.8.0
* pandas
* numpy
### Result:

The results indicate that the class rebalance has helped to improve the results.
After class rebalance, the model is more accurate.
The model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.
